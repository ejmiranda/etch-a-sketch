**Description:**
- From The Odin Project's [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).
- Create a version of Etch-A-Sketch that allows painting with mouse hover.
- Each square on the canvas grid is painted with a random RGB color.
- Each pass darkens the original color until it becomes black.
- Users can press `New` and select a new canvas of size 16 to 48.
- Include animation for showing/hidding the size selection panel.
- Users can press `Clear` to wipe the colors and start over in the current canvas.
